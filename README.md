# Water-Drinking-Advisories-in-Canada

This project will be used to create visualizations showing trends over time of the increase or decrease of drinking water advisories (DWAs) across different areas in Canada. An emphasis is placed on health authorities within British Columbia.

Access to clean drinking water is not something that every Canadian has access to, and there are hundreds of DWAs that have been in place for over 5 years. DWAs are put into place to warn Canadians of potential harms in drinking water or even water that is used to clean with.

The datasets have the dates pulled at the beginning of each name. The data cleaning cleaning was done query by query. When dealing with columns that have dates in them, I corverted the date to remove the zeroed out time. I then removed the columns and renamed the converted columns to the original name column. This isn't necessary, but my later queries include the converted date column with the original name.
