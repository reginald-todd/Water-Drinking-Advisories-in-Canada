# Water-Drinking-Advisories-in-BC

This project will be used to create visualizations showing trends over time of the increase or decrease of drinking water advisories (DWAs) across different areas in Canada. An emphasis is placed on health authorities within British Columbia.

Access to clean drinking water is not something that every Canadian has access to, and there are hundreds of DWAs that have been in place for over 5 years. There is also one instance in the uploaded datasets of a DWA lasting as long as 35 years. DWAs are put into place to warn Canadians of potential harms in drinking water or even water that is used to clean with.

Data cleaning and calculations are attached. There are two files that calculate the total DWA per authority or province, and total years greater than 5. This number can be adjusted to see how many DWAs have lasted for a longer period of time (for example: 10 or 20 years).
